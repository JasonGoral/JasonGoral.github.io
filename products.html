				When you have a kid your going to be buying a <strong>lot</strong> of items for your young one. Sometimes you end up with a great product that entertains and educates your kid or makes your life easier.  Other times you end up with products that underpreform, ending up as expensive clutter or worse yet are cheaply made that bread or are so flimsy you don't trust them to hold up.
			<p>
				This is just one familys opinion of how we found the gear that we bought for Luka, rating it on how much Luka seemed to enjoy it.  The value based on the cost verses how often we used it as well as any other features that stood out.

				<h2 class="indepthheader">B.O.B. Revolution Flex 3</h2>
				<p>This is one of Jason's favorites, this bad boy is the SUV of strollers.  If people dont't move out of the way for you it moves them for you.  It has beefy shocks that have two settings to improve the stiffness for heavier kids, the best canopy I have seen on a stroller and with the large air filled wheels it will roll through and over almost anything.</p>

				<p>There are also some accessories that are available spicifically for this stroller that are quite well done.  The weather shield fits very snugly over the child making the carrying area quite wind and rain proof.  We also liked the caddy that sits up near the parent for drinks and extra cargo, it came with a small pump for the tires that works well.  The final accessory we have is the child snack tray, it snaps on easily and holds snacks but it had an odd shaped hole for the childs sippy cup and once he was old enough to hold his own food it seemed like it was game over for this accesory and it has sat collecting dust since.</p>

			<p>Some of the issues we have had with the stroller are as follows.  Th size is quite large, some elevators and store isles were not built to accomodate the width or turning radius of this stoller.  It will fit on the bus and streetcars but if you get stuck in the isle you are quite the roadblock.  The shock adjustment resets when you fold up the stroller, when you unfold it the default setting is up to 50lbs but once your child outgrows this weight you will have to reset the shocks every time you open up the stroller.  When you fold up the stroller for travel there is no automatic lock on the stoller to keep it from unfolding again, you have to loop a strap over the bar and then clip it on manually.  The size of the stroller collapsed is also quite large, we can fit it into our SUV trunk barely.(They allow you to easily take off the back two wheels to make more room side to side for smaller trunks but I would definatly measure before purchasing if you have anything other than a <strong>Huge</strong> trunk.)</p>

			<p>The highlights of this product are the canopy, it covers your child down to the knees and there is always a setting to keep the sun off their face.  Also the peek-a-boo window in the top has magnetic locks on it and is very quiet when checking in on the passenger area.  The difference between pushing this stroller over any kind of rough terrain or piles of snow/sand and a regular stroller is night and day, you can roll over near anything without bouceing around your child and it makes going offroad or getting trough snow bank ridges a breeze.  Our second stroller is smaller and more nimble for trips in crowds but with the difference in the suspention and the weather sheild makes it a second choice most of the time, escpecially in the winter.  </p>

				<img src="images/batmanchair.jpg" alt="pic not available" class="leftfloat">
				<h2 class="indepthheader">KidsEmbrace DC Comics Batman Deluxe High Chair</h2>
				<p>This is a sturdy and stable highchair, it functions as advertised and so far we have liked using it. Luka has not been able to squirm his way out of the seat, an ideal feature for a highchair.</p>

				<p>The chair is lightly padded and covered in a thick black vinyl, this makes clean up after meals easy and the black colour hides any stains.  There is a sturdy post between the childs legs when seated as well as a lap belt. Between the two it keeps the kid in place and it would be difficult for any accidental falls to occur.  Underneath the seat there is a large basket for storage that works well to keep the seat more stable if loaded with something heavy.  Just be careful what you keep underneath as it is right in the childs drop zone so to speak and whatever is under there will get covered in food.  The tray also easily slides in and out with one hand to make it easier to get the child in and out of the seat.</p>

			<p>The height adjustment on the seat leaves is not ideal. At the highest setting the tray comes just inline with a regular table top, setting it any lower is awkward to sit yourself and feed by hand.  This is less of an issue as Luka learns to feed himself but we still havn't adjusted the height from all the way up since the day we started using it.  The solid black colour of most of the seat while not showing stains it is also harder to see if there is any food left on the seat after cleaning and a few times there has been a bit of leftover food noticed on the seat during the next feeding after it dries and crusts up.  The only thing that isn't black on the chair is the removable tray top and you only get one of them so you have to clean and replace it every meal, a second tray would have been a nice addition.  It is a light grey colour and it still has the ghosts of peaches past and other stains tattooed lightly into the topside of the tray.</p>

			<p>For what matters this is a good highchair, Luka seems comfortable enough to eat there and I trust that it won't fall over or allow him to squirm out of the seat.  Clean up is easy and after a year of use it is holding up quite well.  If it came with an extra tray top and the adjustment for height were set to a higher range this chair would be near perfect.</p>

				<h2 class="indepthheader">Paw Patrol Kids Ride-On Play Set</h2>

				<p>Luka likes touring around on his Paw Patroller, it rolls back and forth on its functional hard plastic wheels, has handlebars that don't steer and the wide plastic seat folds down into a ramp to play with the two plastic cars that were included.  The final feature are the two buttons near the handlebars that each make a sound when pressed, more on those later.</p>

				<p>Luka enjoys the mobility that this toy gives him, it has a wide seat but is low enough to the ground he can straddle it and push back and forth with is feet.  Suprisingly he has taken very few falls off of this toy as he is able to hang on well to the solid well placed handles and the seat is quite wide.  We purchased the ride on after Luka had tried one at one of his programs and seemed to take a liking to it and the one we have at home has become one of his favorite things to play with.</p>

			<p>If your looking for a serious ride on for an active kid that will rip around the house on it I would look elsewhere, the steering doesn't exist and the wheels are prone to slide sideways if you try and force a turn. Now on to the sound buttons, the first button cycled between a dog barking, an engine starting and a siren sound while the other button plays a ten second song. <em>There is no volume control or on/off button!</em> Now you can say toys that make sounds get annoying over time in general but there is something soul tearing about these two buttons being mashed over and over again.</p>

			<p>Overall for our use it is a great toy and as a bonus Luka doesn't seem to get tired of playing with it fast.  It's not made to be a vehicle per say but just look the part so not recommended if you are looking for something bike like.  The sound features can be annoying depending on how its played with and your tolerance for such things.</p>

				<h2 class="indepthheader">LILLE Baby Carrier</h2>
				<p>This was supposed to be a flexable baby carrier that you could load up your child into many different ways to travel hands free.  We found no matter how we loaded up blankets in the bottom (suggested in the instructions) or adjusted the straps and flaps Luka and the person straped to him were never comfortable for long.  In fact it would be fair to say that Luka hated being in the thing and would squirm and fuss nonstop.</p>

				<p>One thing the carrier did well is that it is very adjustable and you could spread the weight well between your shoulders and hips and the straps to hold the child could be snugged up well enough that they couldn't just fall out. The straps that wraps around the parent are well padded and breathable and work well for comfort over long periods. The first time we tried to strap on Luka it was a struggle until we found a way to put the carrier on part way and then scoop him into the front as you looped the shoulder straps on.</p>

			<p>Here is where the trouble started, once in the carrier Luka would endlessly poke at your face, pull your hair, kick in your guts and many other uncomfortable moves as he tried to find a way to freedom. This might be more Lukas issue than that of the carrier but either way it didn't work as a good way to carry him around for long.</p>

			<p>Perhaps your child will like the ride, perhaps not but for us we ended up selling it online because as a way to carry him around it was a solid no from Luka. Perhaps with some more experimentation (there was too many ways to carry and adjust the pouch it seemed) we could have found some way to carry in it that Luka would stand but as a new parent who has the time and energy for that. We had to give it a no from Luka and a no from the parents just based on how fussy he was inside of the thing when strapped up and on the move.</p>
